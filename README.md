# R&D Work Repository - Xeven Work

## Introduction
This repository, titled **Xeven Work**, serves as a collection of my **Research and Development (R&D)** work conducted during my office hours as an **ML Engineer specializing in NLP**. It includes experiments, prototype implementations, and exploratory tasks focused on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Generative AI (GenAI)**.

## Description
The purpose of this repository is to document my learning, experiments, and solutions developed while tackling real-world challenges in NLP, Generative AI, and vector database applications. Each project or experiment reflects a step toward enhancing efficiency, creating innovative solutions, or exploring cutting-edge techniques in the field.

### Key Areas of Focus:
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**
  - Text classification, sentiment analysis, summarization, and named entity recognition.
  - Experimentation with transformers, embeddings, and other state-of-the-art models.

- **Generative AI (GenAI):**
  - Developing and fine-tuning generative models for text generation.
  - Working with Gemini LLM, OpenAI LLMs, and other advanced language models.

- **Vector Databases:**
  - Implementation and experimentation with Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate, and pgvector.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**
  - Developing traditional RAG pipelines using LangChain.
  - Building **Adaptive RAG** systems with LangGraph for dynamic query routing and hybrid search capabilities.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks:**
  - NLP: SpaCy, Hugging Face Transformers, NLTK
  - GenAI: GPT-based models, Cohere, OpenAI API
  - RAG: LangChain, LangGraph
- **Vector Databases:** Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate, pgvector
- **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit
- **Experimentation Platforms:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

## Highlights
- **FastAPI Development:** Created APIs to integrate with various components including LLMs and vector databases.
- **Gemini and OpenAI LLMs:** Prototyped and tested language models for text understanding and generation.
- **Embedding Models:** Worked with advanced embedding techniques to improve text similarity and retrieval tasks.
- **Vector Database Integration:** Implemented and optimized workflows with Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate, and pgvector for high-performance vector search.
- **RAG and Adaptive RAG Systems:** Designed retrieval-augmented generation pipelines for enhanced document retrieval and re-ranking.
